By Dieter Brehm  
QEA Robots Module Challenge - The Bridge of Doom. MATLAB code to run a robot vaccuum through a parametric curve.

## How to run  
Run robot-plotter.py, and then if desired, go through the cells of visualize to generate plots of the paths and to determine theoretical versus experimental path error.

## How to develop
MATLAB is pretty interesting. Open these matlab files and go!
